# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 7th, 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Solved 2 problems from 30-Day LeetCoding Challenge (yesterday's and today's problem). [Tomaz](https://github.com/tomaz1502) and I did a mock interview.

**Thoughts**: I didn't find the problems too hard to solve it, they were kinda easy. However, I took more than 1 hour to find the best solution -- linear and with constant space complexity -- to the mock interview's problem. I was not really prepared, moodwise, to do it.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.
**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday
**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.
**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
