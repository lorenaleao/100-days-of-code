# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 8th, 2020, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Solved 2 problems from 30-Day LeetCoding Challenge (yesterday's [Counting Elements](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/30-day-leetcoding-challenge/528/week-1/3289/) and today's [Middle of the Linked List](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/30-day-leetcoding-challenge/529/week-2/3290/) problem). [Tomaz](https://github.com/tomaz1502) and I did a mock interview. I solved the [problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKu_SEDAykw) to find if an array of integers has a pair whose sum is equal to some number k.

**Thoughts**: I didn't find the problems too hard to solve, they were kinda easy. However, I took more than 1 hour to find the best solution -- linear and with constant space complexity -- to the mock interview's problem. I was not really prepared, moodwise, to do it.

### Day 1: April 10th, 2020, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Solved [Min Stack](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/30-day-leetcoding-challenge/529/week-2/3292/) problem from 30-Day LeetCoding Challenge. 

**Thoughts**: I had solved this problem before, so it was easy to do it again.

### Day 2: April 11th, 2020, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I implemented a solution to [Happy Number](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/30-day-leetcoding-challenge/528/week-1/3284/) problem and tried to solve this other one: [Backspace String Compare](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/30-day-leetcoding-challenge/529/week-2/3291/). Both are from 30-Day LeetCoding Challenge. I reviewed all the solutions to the challenge problems that I have already solved by reading my solutions and watching Errichto's videos. The problems reviewed were:

1. [Happy Number](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/30-day-leetcoding-challenge/528/week-1/3284/) (link video)
2. [Maximum Subarray](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/30-day-leetcoding-challenge/528/week-1/3285/)
3. [Move Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/30-day-leetcoding-challenge/528/week-1/3286/)
4. [Group Anagrams](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/30-day-leetcoding-challenge/528/week-1/3288/)
5. [Counting Elements](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/30-day-leetcoding-challenge/528/week-1/3289/)
6. [Middle of the Linked List](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/30-day-leetcoding-challenge/529/week-2/3290/)
7. [Min Stack](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/30-day-leetcoding-challenge/529/week-2/3292/)

**Thoughts**: I didn't know Kadane's algorithm for the maximum subarray problem yet. So, it was good to learn that. I kinda implemented it without knowing it but after a friend gave me a hint on how to think about the problem. I also read this article: [Kadane’s Algorithm — (Dynamic Programming) — How and Why does it Work?](https://medium.com/@rsinghal757/kadanes-algorithm-dynamic-programming-how-and-why-does-it-work-3fd8849ed73d) by Rohit Singhal on Medium, which I liked.

### Day 3: April 12th, 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Solved [Last Stone Weight](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/30-day-leetcoding-challenge/529/week-2/3297/) problem from 30-Day LeetCoding Challenge. 

**Thoughts**: Sorting the list of numbers and simulating the process, it was easy to solve it. Still have to think in an implementation using heap.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)
**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.
**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday
**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.
**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
